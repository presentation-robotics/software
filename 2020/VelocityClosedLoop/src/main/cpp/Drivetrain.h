/**

 *
 * Be sure to select the correct feedback sensor using configSelectedFeedbackSensor() below.
 *
 * After deploying/debugging this to your RIO, first use the left Y-stick
 * to throttle the Talon manually.  This will confirm your hardware setup.
 * Be sure to confirm that when the Talon is driving forward (green) the
 * position sensor is moving in a positive direction.  If this is not the cause
 * flip the boolean input to the SetSensorPhase() call below.
 *
 * Once you've ensured your feedback device is in-phase with the motor,
 * use the button shortcuts to servo to target velocity.
 *
 * Tweak the PID gains accordingly.
