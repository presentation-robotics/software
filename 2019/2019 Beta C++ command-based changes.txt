	Guide for Porting 2018 Robot Project into 2019 Beta Tools	
	
	- Language C++ 
	- Command-based Robot template
	- Constructed using RobotBuilder
	- Utilizes CAN TalonSRX
	- Utilizes NavX MXP

1) (Workaround) Delete the unnecessary target platform in build.gradle
(This failed for any configuration that tried to use CTRE libraries)

Delete the following line (and leave the 'roborio' target platform)

    targetPlatform 'Desktop'

2) (Workaround) Modify the WPILib.h in the base include to remove SampleRobot.h
(Removes annoying warnings about SampleRobot being deprecated)

From within VS Code:
	- Locate the build entry in the left-hand navigation pane
	- Expand the path: 

build/tmp/expandedArchives/expandedArchives\wpilibc-cpp-2019.1.1-beta-2-headers.zip_...
	
From Windows Explorer
	- Locate the file (for our team the project root is at Robot2019)
	
C:\Users\<yourPathToYourProject>\Robot2019\build\tmp\expandedArchives\wpilibc-cpp-2019.1.1-beta-2-headers.zip_...

Locate frc/WPILib.h (NOT the WPILib.h at top level!) and comment out the line
	#include "frc/SampleRobot.h"

3) (Porting change) All WPILib includes must be prefixed with frc/ and update the namespace
(Allows existing include files to be located by Intellisense and linker)

Ex.
	#incluce "WPILib.h"
	#include "LiveWindow/LiveWindow.h"
	#include "Commands/Subsystem.h"
	#include "Commands/Command.h"
	#include "Commands/CommandGroup.h"

becomes

	#include "frc/WPILib.h"
	#include "frc/livewindow/LiveWindow.h"
	#include "frc/Commands/Subsystem.h"
	#include "frc/Commands/Command.h"
	#include "frc/Commands/CommandGroup.h"

	
4) (Porting change) All WPILib calls and references must be prefixed with frc:: or else the 
namespace needs to be added after the include references
(Allows existing WPILib calls to be defined correctly)

Ex.
	shared_ptr<DifferentialDrive> robotDrive;
	SmartDashboard::GetNumber(...);
	Timer	timer1;

becomes
	
	shared_ptr<frc::DifferentialDrive> robotDrive;
	frc::SmartDashboard::GetNumber(...);
	frc::Timer	timer1;

or add this line after the includes in each file that uses WPILib

	using namespace frc;
	
5) (Porting change) Add CTRE include reference into subsystem include files when using the 
libraries for CAN TalonSRX, etc. This impacts in making calls in Subsystems.

(This worked previously in .cpp files in our code but has changed in 2019.)

	#include "ctre/Phoenix.h"
